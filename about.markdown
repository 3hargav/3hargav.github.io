Hi there!

I'm Bhargav Kadupukutla.
I work at [Incture technologies](http://www.incture.com). 
My work involves creating digital applications mainly for businesses.
Yep, it's not quite cool :(

I live in Bangalore, although I am from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.
I graduated from NIT Silchar in 2020 with a Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineerig.
I am passionate about building applications for real-world problems .
In the long run, I’m interested in how technology will shape the future of our society, and hope to steer it in a positive direction.

Thanks for stopping by! You can read about my projects and experiences on my blog or download my [résumé]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Bhargav_Resum.pdf). Feel free to get in touch using the social links below.
